TLDR: 

Apps are planned and designed by UX Designers, get built by Software Engineers, and then passed to DevOps Engineers to be deployed and scaled.

/////////////////////////////////////



A UX Designer defines and plans how a product should look, feel, work etc to maximize the user's experience (UX) of the product, which is how a user feels about interacting with a product, system, or service. Unlike User Interface (UI) designers that focus on the aesthetics of a product, UX designers consider not only the look, but the feel and usability of a product. They use tools like Figma to create High Fidelity Designs (where they introduce UI elements and how the user might interact with the final design) and pass them to Front-End Software Engineers to develop products that meet the specs. The goals of UX designers are to make products that are useful, usable, enjoyable, and accessible.



DevOps Engineers focus on the process after the code. This includes Deployment, Cloud, Monitoring, Database Management, Repository Management, Configuration/Provisioning, Release Management, Logging, Build, Test, Containerization, Collaboration, and Security. After developers push their code to git, it enters the next stage of the Software Development Life Cycle. Essentially, a DevOps engineer takes the app that developers made and make sure it's bug free and runs well for users. They understand the entire flow from code to production, how various parts of apps communicate with each other and how all of these tie together into the automation process.
